## C++ Basics and Practice Exercises

This repository contains basic C++ programs that demonstrate fundamental concepts in the language. Each example focuses on a key programming topic, from simple output to functions and control structures.

### 1. Hello World
- Basic program to print "Hello, World!" to the console.

### 2. Variable Declaration
- Demonstrates different data types in C++ including `int`, `double`, `char`, and `string`.

### 3. User Input
- Accepts user input for a name and age and then prints a greeting message.

### 4. Basic Arithmetic Operations
- Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus operations on integers.

### 5. If Statement
- Checks if a person is an adult based on age using an `if` statement.

### 6. If-Else Statement
- Determines if a person is an adult or a minor using `if-else`.

### 7. If-Else If-Else Ladder
- Categorizes a person as a minor, an adult, or a senior citizen based on age.

### 8. For Loop
- Demonstrates the use of a `for` loop by printing iteration numbers.

### 9. While Loop
- Uses a `while` loop to print iteration numbers.

### 10. Functions - Addition
- Defines and uses a function to add two numbers.

### 11. Functions - Another Example
- Similar to the previous function example but with different input values.

### 12. Functions - Greeting
- Demonstrates a function that takes a `string` parameter and prints a greeting message.

## Practice Exercises

### 13.1 Even or Odd Checker
- Uses a function to check if a user-entered number is even or odd.

### 13.2 Array Looping
- Demonstrates looping through an array and printing its elements.

### 13.3 Simple Calculator
- Implements a basic calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## How to Run the Programs
1. Install a C++ compiler (e.g., g++ for Linux/Mac or MinGW for Windows).
2. Copy and save the desired program as a `.cpp` file.
3. Compile the file using the following command:
   ```
   g++ filename.cpp -o output
   ```
4. Run the compiled program:
   ```
   ./output
   ```
